## üöÄ Introduction

**ai-zero-shot-classifier** is a powerful JavaScript library that leverages advanced AI embeddings to perform zero-shot text classification. Whether you're dealing with unlabelled data or seeking to classify text against dynamic and user-defined labels, this library provides a seamless and efficient solution.

## üßê Why ai-zero-shot-classifier?

### **The Problem**
In many real-world applications, acquiring labeled data for training classification models is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes impractical. Traditional supervised learning approaches require vast amounts of annotated data, which isn't always feasible to obtain. Moreover, adapting models to new, unforeseen categories necessitates retraining, which can be resource-intensive.

### **The Innovation**
**ai-zero-shot-classifier** addresses these challenges by using pre-trained embeddings to classify text without any task-specific training. You simply define your labels dynamically, and the classifier matches your data with the closest label based on semantic similarity.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Labels**: Classify text using labels you define on the fly.
- **Multiple Similarity Functions**: Supports cosine similarity, dot product, and Euclidean distance.
- **Batch Processing**: Handles embeddings and similarity calculations efficiently using customizable batch sizes and concurrency.
- **Integration-Friendly**: Works seamlessly with OpenAI embeddings and can be easily integrated into your application.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install ai-zero-shot-classifier
```

or

```bash
yarn add ai-zero-shot-classifier
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
import classify from 'ai-zero-shot-classifier';

const labels = ['Technology', 'Health', 'Finance'];
const data = [
  'Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries.',
  'The stock market has seen unprecedented growth.',
  'Healthcare advancements are improving lives.'
];

classify({ labels, data, config: { similarity: 'cosine' } })
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```
